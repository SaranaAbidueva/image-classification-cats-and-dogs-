Using convolutional neural networks for binary image classification.

Comparison of the efficiency of the architecture of convolutional neural networks for objects on the image.
The dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data contains 25000 images of cats and dogs with tags. 
Thus, the problem of binary classification was solved. A comparative analysis of several architectures and sets of their parameters has been made.
The quality criterion is the accuracy on the validation set.

Accuracy on best model: 0,9267
